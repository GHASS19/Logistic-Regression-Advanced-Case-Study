## Logistic Regression - Height, Weight, & Gender
In this project, I built a logistic regression model that uses a person's height & weight to predict their gender with 92% accuracy.

	Sex	Height	Weight
0	Male	73.847017	241.893563
1	Male	68.781904	162.310473
2	Male	74.110105	212.740856
3	Male	71.730978	220.042470
4	Male	69.881796	206.349801
